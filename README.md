# 3d-trajectory-prediction-kalman
Tracking and predicting the trajectory of an object (using a Kalman Filter) in 3d realtime using OpenCV and Python

For this program to work as it is supposed, the following setup is required:
- Two (identical) camera's connected to the computer as webcams
- The two cameras are set on the same height, pointing in the same direction and a few centimeters apart (not too far apart, max ~25cm or something)
- A green object (like a ball) being thrown on a background without other green objects.


This was the end result (for now) of a project with arturkuznetsou in 2019.
